In this schema, we have four models: Vegetable, Cereal, Recipe, and RecipeIngredient.

The Vegetable model represents a vegetable item in the inventory. It has fields for id (a unique identifier), name (the name of the vegetable), quantity (the quantity of the vegetable available), unit (the unit of measurement for the vegetable quantity), createdAt (the datetime when the vegetable was added to the inventory), and updatedAt (the datetime when the vegetable was last updated).

The Cereal model represents a cereal item in the inventory. It has fields for id (a unique identifier), name (the name of the cereal), quantity (the quantity of the cereal available), unit (the unit of measurement for the cereal quantity), createdAt (the datetime when the cereal was added to the inventory), and updatedAt (the datetime when the cereal was last updated).

The Recipe model represents a recipe for a meal. It has fields for id (a unique identifier), title (the title of the recipe), description (an optional description of the recipe), ingredients (an array of recipe ingredients), createdAt (the datetime when the recipe was created), and updatedAt (the datetime when the recipe was last updated).

The RecipeIngredient model represents an ingredient used in a recipe. It has fields for id (a unique identifier), quantity (the quantity of the ingredient required), unit (the unit of measurement for the ingredient quantity), recipeId (the foreign key referencing the id field of the Recipe model), vegetableId (the foreign key referencing the id field of the Vegetable model, optional), cerealId (the foreign key referencing the id field of the Cereal model, optional), recipe (a relation to the Recipe model, specifying the recipe the ingredient belongs to), vegetable (an optional relation to the Vegetable model, specifying the vegetable ingredient, if applicable), and cereal (an optional relation to the Cereal model, specifying the cereal ingredient, if applicable).

This schema allows you to track the inventory of vegetables and cereals, as well as plan recipes by specifying the required ingredients. You can further customize this schema based on your specific requirements for the home cooking application.
